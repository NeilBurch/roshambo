# roshambo

This branch contains a modified version of the test suite used in the first
International RoShamBo Programming Competition, intended for inclusion in
OpenSpiel. `main()` has been commented out, as has the declaration of `bzero()`
on line 2159, which caused an error when building on Mac OS X. The bot
Greenberg, winner of the second competition held in 2000, has been added to
the list of bots.
