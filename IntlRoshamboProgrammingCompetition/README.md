This directory hosts code relevant to the International RoShamBo Competition
held in 1999 and 2000 by Darse Billings at the University of Alberta
(https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~darse/rsbpc.html). 
All the code used in the first competition, including the entire field of bots,
is open source and contained within the file `rsb-ts1.c` 
(reproduced from http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~darse/rsb-ts1.c).
The only modification that has been made is commenting out the main function so
it can be imported into OpenSpiel (https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel).

No additional code from the second competition was officially released, but
Andrzej Nagorko, the author of the winning entrant Greenberg, independently
released the botâ€™s source code (http://www.mathpuzzle.com/older.htm and 
http://www.mathpuzzle.com/greenberg.c).
